# civ6-map-rs
A (WIP) parser for Sid Meier's Civilization VI save files, whose goal is to extract the saved map and show the position of cities and units.

# Credits
I adapted a lot of code, and learnt about the file format, from :
  - [civ6-save-parser](https://github.com/pydt/civ6-save-parser) from [Play Your Damn Turn](https://www.playyourdamnturn.com/)
  - [civ6save-editing](https://github.com/lucienmaloney/civ6save-editing) from [Lucien Maloney](https://github.com/lucienmaloney)
